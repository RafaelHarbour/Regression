# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) vs Random Forest Regression

The data is looking at the consumer price index (CPI) in the UK and its relation with the different energy prices.
The raw data used can be accessed in the datasets/raw_data directory.
The processed data can be accessed in the datasets directory.

## CPI Analysis

I have done some analysis accross every different CPI sector. This can be viewed in the **Energy - CPI Regression Analysis** notebook.

### Further Improvements

- [ ] Have a deeper look into the communication sector (data looks non-linear, seems to have a quadratic relationship)

---

## Model comparison

I have conducted a comparison between MLR and Random Forest regression in order to determine the optimal model for forecasting future outcomes with our data.

### Further Improvements

- [ ] Do multiple tests for the model comparisons (with different random seeds)
